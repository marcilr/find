"Basic usage of -exec

The -exec option takes an external utility with optional
arguments as its argument and executes it.

If the string {} is present anywhere in the given command,
each instance of it will be replaced by the pathname
currently being processed (e.g. ./some/path/FILENAME).
In most shells, the two characters {} does not need to be
quoted.

The command needs to be terminated with a ; for find to
know where it ends (as there may be further options
afterwards).  To protect the ; from the shell, it needs to
be quoted as \; or ';', otherwise the shell will see it as
the end of the find command.

Example (the \ at the end of the first two lines are just
for line continuations):

  find . -type f -name '*.txt'      \
     -exec grep -q 'hello' {} ';'   \
     -exec cat {} ';'

This will find all regular files (-type f) whose names
matches the pattern *.txt in or below the current directory.
It will then test whether the string hello occurs in any of
the found files using grep -q (which does not produce any
output, just an exit status).  For those files that contain
the string, cat will be executed to output the contents of
the file to the terminal.

Each -exec also acts like a "test" on the pathnames found by
find, just like -type and -name does.  If the command returns
a zero exit status (signifying "success"), the next part of
the find command is considered, otherwise the find command
continues with the next pathname.  This is used in the
example above to find files that contain the string hello,
but to ignore all other files.

The above example illustrates the two most common use cases
of -exec:

1. As a test to further restrict the search.
2. To perform some kind of action on the found pathname
   (usually, but not necessarily, at the end of the find
   command)."

-exec command ;
    Execute command; true if 0 status is returned.  All following
    arguments to find are taken to be arguments to the command
    until an argument consisting of ‘;’ is encountered.  The string 
    ‘{}’ is replaced by the current file name being processed
    everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just
    in arguments where it is alone, as in some versions of find.
    Both of these constructions might need to be escaped (with a ‘\’)
    or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the
    EXAMPLES section for examples of the use of the -exec option.
    The specified command is run once for each matched file.  The
    command is executed in the starting directory.   There are
    unavoidable security problems surrounding use of the -exec action;
    you should use the -execdir option instead.
